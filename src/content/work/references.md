### Alfie Sanchez

Designer at Hero Digital
September 2022, Alfie worked with Riley on the same team

We brought Riley on to help lead a team of production designers through a challenging high-speed project for an industry-leading client known for having exacting standards. Riley was an indispensable part of the team, consistently producing high-quality work while navigating and supporting the other designers through various challenges and blockers on the road to success. He bravely took on some of the toughest parts of the project with a positive mindset and went above and beyond to ensure a top-notch delivery. 10/10 would recommend, I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with him again!

> On top of being a skilled and dedicated designer, he is also a great mentor who leads with compassion and is eager to lend a hand where can and carry the team to victory.
