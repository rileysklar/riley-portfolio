### The AI-Powered Wedding Website: Revolutionizing Guest Experiences  

As a developer planning my wedding, of course I am going to go all out. Welcome to my **AI-Powered Wedding Website**, a groundbreaking platform designed to make wedding coordination effortless for both the hosts and their guests. Built with **Python** and powered by cutting-edge technologies like **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Pinecone** vector database, and **OpenAI**, this project sets a new standard for modern event planning.  

From providing instant answers about wedding details to managing complex schedules, this system is the ultimate digital concierge for weddings.

#### **Why This Wedding Website Stands Out**  

Weddings are magical, but managing guest inquiries can be overwhelming. This AI-powered platform addresses that with features like:  
- **Instant Guest Support**: The AI chatbot provides fast, accurate responses to questions like, ‚ÄúWhat time is the ceremony?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhere can I park?‚Äù  
- **Smart Search Capabilities**: Thanks to its integration with a **vector database**, the website delivers precise, context-aware answers.  
- **Seamless Guest Interaction**: A polished, user-friendly interface ensures every guest feels connected to the celebration.

#### **Key Technical Features**  

##### **1. Python-Powered Backend**  
- **Web Scraping**: Python‚Äôs BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries scrape relevant wedding details (e.g., event locations, schedules, FAQs) from predefined sources.  
- **Data Processing**: Text is chunked and optimized for fast retrieval using Python‚Äôs advanced processing libraries.  
- **FastAPI Framework**: The backend leverages FastAPI to create secure, efficient RESTful endpoints for handling guest queries.  

```python
class WebScraper:
    """A class to handle recursive web scraping operations."""
    
    def __init__(self, base_url: str, max_depth: int = 10, delay: float = 1.0):
        """
        Initialize the web scraper with a base URL.
        
        Args:
            base_url (str): The starting URL for scraping
            max_depth (int): Maximum depth for recursive scraping
            delay (float): Delay between requests in seconds
        """
        if not validators.url(base_url):
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid URL provided: {base_url}")
            
        self.base_url = base_url.rstrip('/')
        self.domain = urlparse(base_url).netloc
        self.max_depth = max_depth
        self.delay = delay
        self.visited_urls: Set[str] = set()
        
        # Initialize Chrome options
        chrome_options = Options()
        chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")  # Run in headless mode
        chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-gpu")
        chrome_options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
        chrome_options.add_argument("--disable-dev-shm-usage")
        chrome_options.add_argument("--window-size=1920,1080")
        
        # Initialize the WebDriver
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome(
            service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()),
            options=chrome_options
        )
```

##### **2. Vector Database with Pinecone**  
- **Efficient Storage**: Wedding information is stored as vector embeddings in Pinecone, enabling lightning-fast searches.  
- **Scalable Retrieval**: The database handles increasing guest queries effortlessly, ensuring performance remains smooth.  
- **RAG Integration**: By combining Pinecone‚Äôs vector search with OpenAI‚Äôs language model, the system provides accurate, conversational responses.  

##### **3. RAG-Based AI Querying**  
- **OpenAI GPT Integration**: The chatbot interprets user queries, retrieves relevant data, and generates human-like responses with source attribution.  
- **Context Awareness**: Responses are tailored to the specific details of the wedding, ensuring relevance and clarity.  

##### **4. Robust Logging and Error Handling**  
- **Logging with Python**: All major operations, from web scraping to API queries, are logged for transparency and debugging.  
- **Graceful Error Management**: The system anticipates and handles unexpected issues, like API rate limits or missing data, without disrupting the user experience.  

---

#### **Frontend Integration**  

While the backend is powered by Python, the frontend leverages modern tools for an interactive user experience:  
- **React and Astro**: Build a responsive, mobile-first interface for guests to interact with the AI chatbot and view event details.  
- **TailwindCSS**: Adds a sleek, modern aesthetic to the design, enhancing usability.  
- **Real-Time Communication**: Python APIs ensure seamless interaction between the backend and frontend, delivering instant answers to guest inquiries.  

---

#### **How It Works**  

1. **Scraping and Indexing**: Python scripts gather and preprocess wedding information.  
2. **Vector Storage**: Pinecone indexes the processed data for efficient retrieval.  
3. **Query Resolution**: FastAPI handles user questions, passing them to OpenAI GPT for dynamic, contextually accurate responses.

```python
# Chat input
if prompt := st.chat_input("Ask a question about the website..."):
    # Add user message to chat history
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
    
    # Display user message
    with st.chat_message("user"):
        st.markdown(prompt)
    
    # Get AI response
    with st.chat_message("assistant"):
        with st.spinner("Thinking..."):
            response = rag_engine.query(prompt)
            answer = response["answer"]
            sources = [doc.metadata.get('source', 'Unknown source') 
                      for doc in response["source_documents"]]
            
            # Display response
            st.markdown(answer)
            if sources:
                with st.expander("View Sources"):
                    for i, source in enumerate(sources, 1):
                        st.markdown(f"{i}. {source}")
            
            # Add assistant message to chat history
            st.session_state.messages.append({
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": answer,
                "sources": sources
            }) 
```

#### **Why Python and Pinecone?**  

The combination of **Python** and **Pinecone** ensures unmatched performance and flexibility:  
- **Python‚Äôs Ecosystem**: With libraries like FastAPI, NumPy, and BeautifulSoup, Python simplifies complex workflows like data scraping, preprocessing, and API development.  
- **Pinecone‚Äôs Speed**: The vector database guarantees quick retrieval of relevant information, even as data volume scales.  
- **RAG Framework**: This architecture marries Python‚Äôs strengths with Pinecone and OpenAI for a truly innovative solution.
