The journey of becoming a developer is as diverse as it is challenging, especially for those who take the self-taught route. My adventure began with the basics of CSS and HTML, laying the groundwork for what would become a career filled with growth, opportunities, and continuous learning.

### Starting with the Basics: CSS and HTML

Diving into the world of web development, CSS and HTML were my starting points. These foundational skills were crucial in understanding how websites are built and styled. Through countless hours of practice and project-building, I began to grasp the intricacies of web design, setting the stage for my next leap into UI/UX design.

### The Leap into UI/UX Design

As I honed my skills, my interest in the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design grew. This curiosity led me to explore deeper into how design and functionality converge to create seamless user experiences. By mastering design tools and principles, I positioned myself as a UI/UX designer, ready to tackle more complex projects.

### Working with Apple: A Milestone Achieved

One of the defining moments of my career was securing a contract with Apple as a UI Production Designer. Working on a mobile application prototype for iOS, I applied my UI/UX skills to contribute to a project that had the potential to shape future user interactions with Apple devices. This experience not only honed my design skills but also taught me the importance of precision and innovation in technology.

### Expanding Horizons: Agency Life and Learning JavaScript, React, and PHP

After my stint with Apple, I joined an agency, broadening my technical skill set. It was here that I delved into JavaScript, React, and PHP. Agency work provides a fast-paced environment where I could apply my knowledge in real-world projects, further solidifying my understanding of web development and the importance of teamwork in creating complex digital solutions.

### On the Side: Vue.js, React Native, Flutter, and Beyond

Continuing my journey, I began exploring Vue.js, React Native, and Flutter on the side. These technologies opened up new avenues for me in mobile and web application development, allowing me to create more dynamic and interactive user experiences.

### The Unending Path of Learning

The journey of a self-taught developer is marked by continuous learning, adaptation, and perseverance. From the basics of CSS and HTML to working with industry giants like Apple, and now venturing into the realms of Vue.js, React Native, and Flutter, my path reflects the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the tech industry. As I continue to grow and learn, I am reminded that in the world of development, the journey never truly ends—it only becomes more exciting.
